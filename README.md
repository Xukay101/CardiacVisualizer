# CardiacVisualizer

<p align="center"><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xukay101/CardiacVisualizer/master/demo.gif' /></p>

This is a `RUST` implementation of an emulator for the CARDIAC (Cardboard Illustrative Aid to Computation) computer, a teaching tool designed by David Hagelbarger in the late 1960s.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to recreate and simulate the functionality of the CARDIAC computer, providing a modern implementation using the Rust programming language. The emulator allows users to explore the fundamental principles of computation as illustrated by the original CARDIAC design.

## Features
* **RUST Implementation:** The emulator is written in the Rust programming language, leveraging its performance, safety, and modern programming constructs.

* **Educational Tool:** CARDIAC was initially designed for educational purposes, and this emulator continues that tradition by serving as a learning resource for those interested in computer architecture and early computing concepts.

* **Visualization:** The emulator includes a visualizer to enhance the user's understanding of the CARDIAC computer's operation. The provided GIF demonstrates the visual representation of the emulator in action.

## Getting Started
To run the emulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Xukay101/CardiacVisualizer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project:
```bash
cd CardiacVisualizer
```

3. Build and run the emulator
```bash
cargo run
```
This will compile the project and launch the CARDIAC emulator.

## Usage
When running the emulator, you can interact with the CARDIAC simulation. Follow the on-screen instructions or refer to the documentation for guidance on using the emulator's features.
